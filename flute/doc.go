/*
Package flute provides the HTTP client testing framework.
With flute you can define test cases declaratively.
You can test request parameters such as the request path, headers, and body.  And you can also mock the HTTP server.

flute uses https://github.com/stretchr/testify internally,
so it is easy to understand why the test is failed.

Please see the examples https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/flute/tree/master/examples .
